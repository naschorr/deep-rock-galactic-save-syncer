# Deep Rock Galactic Save Syncer
One-click save syncing between Steam and Xbox (Windows) DRG installations!

#### What?
This application automatically discovers the appropriate save directories, determines the age of their latest save, and propagates that save to the other installation's save directory. It also backs up the save being overwritten in case something goes wrong.

#### Notes
You must have an existing save in both the Steam and Xbox (Windows) versions of Deep Rock Galactic. This will not work for transferring saves before starting the game up for the first time on a new platform.
